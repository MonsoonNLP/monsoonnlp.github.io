# MonsoonNLP

This is the core Jekyll repository for the MonsoonNLP site.

MonsoonNLP is creating an email list or blog (similar to Papers with Code) featuring
projects and creators from around the Indian Ocean region. With your support as a reader
and writer, it can become a full-fledged journal.

## Topics
- NLP research and code FOR regional/local languages
- NLP research and code BY developers based in the region
- Citations of local research in major, international papers

## Starting Strong with a First Issue
- I've reached out to a few developers in India and Sri Lanka.
- I plan to include an article which I wrote about monolingual BERTs.
- Planning to reach out to developers in Somalia, the Maldives, and Myanmar
