## Welcome!

This site covers machine learning and natural language processing in the
Indian Ocean region. We highlight regional languages and individual researchers,
as well as projects which have been cited in international research.

We're putting together articles and code projects for the first issue.

This is currently a Jekyll blog, but we will add a mailing list and social
media accounts shortly.
